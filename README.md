# FDM_Mini_Project

### This is a water quality prediction system, where you can input your water quality parameters like the pH, iron content, turbidity etc and get a prediction on whether the water sample you collected is potable or not.

### Our main target audience include policymakers, environmental agencies, water treatment plants, researchers, and communities.

# Technologoes used
## Frontend - ReactJs with vite
## Backend - Azure serverless function apps
## ML models using python scikit-learn library


# How the model has been trained

## I trained 6 models namely Logistic regression classification, SVM, K-NN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms. After evaluating each of those models, I decided to go with the random forest model as it was comparatively better.

## Data preprocessing has been done to handle missing values, categorical values, normalize numeric values and to handle outliers.
